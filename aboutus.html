    <h2>Brief Overview</h2>
    <p>The robotics and makers club was forged from the merger of two different clubs, the robotics club and the makers club. Since then, VRMC has been a place where students refine their creativity, innovation, teamwork and critical thinking skills. It is also a tight knitted community with like-minded people who drive one another to push the boundaries of what can be done, developing critical life and career skills in the process. It is a place where people can feel free to express their ideas and thoughts to achieve something great together.</p>
    <h2>VEX</h2>
    <p>VEX, a dynamic robotics platform, ignites creativity and innovation in students. Boasting robust metal construction, advanced motors, sensors, and an intuitive programming environment, it facilitates hands-on learning. Its modular components and user-friendly software empower students to prototype, program, and customize robots for diverse challenges. Ideal for both beginners and enthusiasts, the VEX spec offers a captivating gateway to STEM concepts, problem-solving, and real-world applications in the thrilling field of robotics.</p>
    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>The programming spec is a closely knitted group of people who are interested in solving coding problems and undertaking programming-related projects. The programming spec learns new concepts and ideas from one another, via an open discussion for obstacles encountered in coding problems. We love to challenge ourselves and push the digital limits.</p>
    <h2>Electronics</h2>
    <p>Electronics is a highly creative specialization that offers the perfect balance between hardware and software. 
It provides members with the freedom to bring their most ambitious ideas to life, allowing them to build anything they can dream up. We Dream, We Tinker, We Engineer.</p>
    <h2>Drones</h2>
    <p>At Drones, we work in 2 main categories: Fixed Wing Planes and Quadcopter Building. We participate in competitions like the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competion, where we come up against tough competition to beat obstacles in our way.</p>
